This folder contains the list of figures in the paper, with figures 3 and 5 being generated using the code in `Total_Manure_3by1_Plt.py` and `Total_FW_3by1_Plt.py` files, respectively. These two python files along with the underlying map boundary shapefile (`Ontario_Boundary_5070.shp`) and data file (`Ontario_30m_Dataset.nc`) are available in the `Code` folder of this repository.
